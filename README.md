Teacher: Maxime Pigeon ([email](mailto:pigeonm@vaniercollege.qc.ca))

## Description

In this course, students will be introduced to client side programming.
They will learn how to manipulate elements of a web page, add
interactivity, and process dynamic data using JavaScript.

## Modality

This course is conducted online synchronously. Team classroom links will
be provided before class. Unless otherwise specified, attendance is
mandatory for each class. Lectures will not be recorded. If you are
absent, it is your responsibility to compensate for the missed session.

Outside of class periods, you can reach me through MIO at any time. On
weekdays, please allow 24 hours for me to respond.

## Pedagogical Approaches and Teaching Methods

Classes will consist of a blend of lectures, live coding sessions, and
exercises. Readings, lecture notes and examples will be provided through
GitHub.

## Assessments

### Homework (10%)

Every class, time will be allocated for the completion of short homework
assignments directly tied to the learning material. Homework assignments
are meant to encourage continuous progress in acquiring the course
competencies. _Their content is not graded._ Students who submit the
assignment before next class will receive a perfect grade.

### Quizzes (7% × 5)

Quizzes are short evaluations designed to assess students' understanding
of a specific notion or concept. Most quizzes are graded using an
automated test suite in order to give feedback quickly, and to
familiarize students with test driven development.

### Project (25%)

Projects are designed to assess students' understanding of the learning
material. As such, they are graded based on the level of proficiency
students exhibit for the course competencies.

### LIA (30%)

Each course includes a Learning Integration Assessment (LIA) that
attests to students' achievement of the course-level learning outcome
that is the main knowledge, skills, and attitudes to be developed.

#### Evaluation Criteria

- Requirements are met.
- Code is readable and consistently formatted.
- Interfaces are well documented.
- Markup is semantic.
- Naming is descriptive and consistent.
- Program flow is decomposed into manageable, logical pieces.
- Common code is unified, and not duplicated.

### Student Proficiency in the Language of Instruction (SPLI)

> Student proficiency in the language of instruction is the ability to
> write, read, speak, and listen in order to communicate effectively at
> the college level. SPLI may also require discipline-specific
> vocabulary, documentation, and communication skills; assessment of
> language skills must account for a minimum of 10% of any take-home
> written assignment or oral presentation in which English is the
> language of expression.

Documenting source code is an integral part of software development.
Clear and well written documentation makes it easier for others
(including your future self) to understand a program, maintain it, and
troubleshoot issues.

Accordingly, 10% of the total grade will be devoted to the assessment of
students' proficiency in the language of instruction. Variable and
function names will be assessed for consistency and correctness, while
comments will be assessed for accuracy and helpfulness.

### Late Submission Policy

Homework submitted during or after the next class will not be accepted,
resulting in a score of 0.

For other types of submissions, no penalties will be applied if prior
arrangements were made with the teacher _before the submission
deadline_. However, if an assessment is submitted after the deadline
without prior arrangements, a deduction of 5% per day will be applied to
the best possible grade.

### Plagiarism

> Cheating and plagiarism are violations of academic integrity and are
> considered to be very serious academic offenses. They undermine the
> legitimacy of the academic degrees awarded by the College and deny
> honest students of some of the rewards of their efforts.
>
> Plagiarism is submitting or presenting work in a course as if it were
> the student's own original and individual work done expressly for that
> course when, in fact, it is not.
>
> The penalty for plagiarism or cheating is a grade of zero for that
> course work or assignment without the possibility of revising that
> course work or assignment or preparing an alternate assignment.
