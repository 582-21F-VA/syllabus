## Description

In this course, students will be introduced to client side programming.
They will learn how to manipulate elements of a web page, add
interactivity, and process dynamic data using JavaScript.

## Modality

This course is conducted online synchronously. Team classroom links will
be provided before class. Unless otherwise specified, attendance is
mandatory for each class. Lectures will not be recorded. If you are
absent, it is your responsibility to compensate for the missed session.

Unfortunately, I am unable to offer office hours. All meetings must take
place during scheduled class time. Outside of class periods, you can
reach me through MIO or Teams at any time. Please allow 24 to 48 hours
for me to respond.

## Pedagogical approache

Classes will consist of a blend of lectures, live coding sessions, and
exercises. Readings, lecture notes and examples will be provided on
GitHub.

## Evaluations

### Homework (10%)

Homework assignments are meant to encourage continuous progress in
acquiring the course competencies. Their content is not graded. Students
who submit the assignment before next class will receive a perfect
grade.

### Exams (4 × 10%)

Exams are short evaluations designed to assess students' understanding
of a specific notion or concept. Most exams are graded using an
automated test suite in order to give feedback quickly, and to
familiarize students with test driven development.

### Project (20%)

Projects are designed to assess students' understanding of the learning
material. As such, they are graded based on the level of proficiency
students exhibit for the course competencies.

### LIA (30%)

Each course includes a Learning Integration Assessment (LIA) that
attests to students' achievement of the course-level learning outcome
that is the main knowledge, skills, and attitudes to be developed.

#### Evaluation Criteria

- Requirements are met.
- Code is readable and consistently formatted.
- Interfaces are well documented.
- Markup is semantic.
- Naming is descriptive and consistent.
- Program flow is decomposed into manageable, logical pieces.
- Common code is unified, and not duplicated.

### Student Proficiency in the Language of Instruction (SPLI)

> Student proficiency in the language of instruction is the ability to
> write, read, speak, and listen in order to communicate effectively at
> the college level. SPLI may also require discipline-specific
> vocabulary, documentation, and communication skills; assessment of
> language skills must account for a minimum of 10% of any take-home
> written assignment or oral presentation in which English is the
> language of expression.

Documenting source code is an integral part of software development.
Clear and well written documentation makes it easier for others
(including your future self) to understand a program, maintain it, and
troubleshoot issues.

Accordingly, 10% of the total grade will be devoted to the assessment of
students' proficiency in the language of instruction. Variable and
function names will be assessed for consistency and correctness, while
comments will be assessed for accuracy and helpfulness.

### Late Submission Policy

Homework submitted during or after the next class will not be accepted,
resulting in a score of 0.

For other types of submissions, no penalties will be applied if prior
arrangements were made with the teacher _before the submission
deadline_. However, if an assessment is submitted after the deadline
without prior arrangements, a deduction of 5% per day will be applied to
the best possible grade.

### Plagiarism

> Cheating and plagiarism are violations of academic integrity and are
> considered to be very serious academic offenses. They undermine the
> legitimacy of the academic degrees awarded by the College and deny
> honest students of some of the rewards of their efforts.
>
> Plagiarism is submitting or presenting work in a course as if it were
> the student's own original and individual work done expressly for that
> course when, in fact, it is not.
>
> The penalty for plagiarism or cheating is a grade of zero for that
> course work or assignment without the possibility of revising that
> course work or assignment or preparing an alternate assignment.

### Generative AI

In this course, you may not submit any work generated by an AI program
such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot as your own. Doing so constitutes
plagiarism. If there are doubts regarding the provenance of your work,
you may be required to explain and reason through your code.
